# AIC-assignment


SOP :

Hi , I’m Abakash From Mech. Department . I’m interested to join AI community because I want to Learn About Tech. Machine Learning & AI & Use it to solve Various Problem faced By People. I want to Explore this Domain & How It can Help Us . I find It easy to Learn For Me , The assignment really ignited the interest to Join AI community . I have Explored MoodI , TechFest & various Things During My Freshie Year & realised , I want to give my Time & Energy , Learning About Technology , & it’s Various implementation .But Why Not Tech Teams then ? I find It easier To learn ML , maybe bcoz I’m Interested in it . Earlier I didn’t wanted To give time to Tech teams , but AI community Is what I Like To give my Time to . AI Community IIT B is a Perfect Place For That . Interested Of My Interest , I started Learning ML , as soon As summer Started & Didn’t Knew Much About Earlier , But created a Model Using (Pandas) Earlier . The Assignment Of AI community was Interesting , It generated an Excitement to Learn Things Further & Explore More & I did Learned To Use TensorFlow Much during This Time . I reached Out to seniors to Find Resources To Learn , Even Though It seemed Easy To Learn , I instead Choose to Learn by seeing Every single Tutorials & view it in Detail . And Joining This , I also Wat to Connect To Like Minded Individuals , Who like to learn about AI , ML , etc & Are inclined to Problem Solving , Using Different Approaches .



Hackathon (Non-Tech Q1 ) :

For a idea , Let’s say the Problem statement is “To Predict a Fraudlent Transaction “  . Before entering a Hackathon , I would research aa bit about the Organisers , companies That are conducting the Hackathon & research about their aim , What do they want , Their previous  Hackathon’s Winners . Then , then the Task is Searching For a Dataset , with relevance , For this problem statement , a dataset On Fraudlent Transaction already exists on Kaggle.com . Search on various websites , search engine Would Give Us a dataset For Training our Model. Then I will Do the EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) of the Training Dataset to Determine the Variables & various Dependencies that can Be Used To Accurately make Predictions . For This I will Use matplot lib , numpy , heatmap ,scatter plot , Histograms To Find out The Correct Dependencies , For example , If a transaction is made from terminals in this Range Of No. Then it’s a fake transaction(These terminals / ports doesn’t exist) . Using Codes , I will clean The data points that are empty in a given Column , by checking datatypes of entries , 	We can determine , If a column is empty(“?” filled inside) or Nan , Then We’ll remove such Data , These alongwith Dataset searching , Should be done in 6-7 days . Then I’ll research on various Models(CNN) To Implement , based On Our Need , Learn how to Implement them to our Benefit . Then I’ll train the Model On the Dataset , Test It using a part of the Same Dataset , Then A different Dataset , then Again Train On Another Dataset , determine accuracy , Train it based On the actual outputs Of the Test Data sets. Fix issues If Found & Determine , How to Increase Accuracy ,  Using Algorithm Tuning . These should Be where I put max Time  to Increase the Accuracy Of Our Model & find out the most correct algorithm & this Should be completed Within 19-20 days Of Start of Hackathon(If It’s 1 Month) . Then I’ll Test The model In real life situations , Collabrating With Various Platforms Which face Fraudlent Transactions(Earlier Amazon, ebay used to Face) Check Using transaction Platfroms . Take feedback & Ask suggestion For Improvements , & then Implements The Improvements
